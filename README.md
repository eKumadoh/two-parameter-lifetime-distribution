# A New Two-Parameter Lifetime Distribution with Bathtub Shape or Increasing Failure Rate

# Overview

This repository contains the full R implementation of a newly proposed two-parameter lifetime distribution designed to model data with bathtub-shaped or monotonically increasing hazard functions.

The repository focuses exclusively on methodological implementation, including distributional definition, estimation, simulation, and application code.

# Implemented Methods

The repository includes code for:

- Random Number Generation
- Likelihood-Based Inference
- Monte Carlo Simulation Framework
  Evaluation metrics:
    -Bias
    -Mean squared error (MSE)
    -Absolute percentage error (APE)
    -Coverage probability (CP)
